All representations of SCIM schemas MUST include a non-empty array with value(s) of the URIs supported by that representation.

This identifier MUST be unique across the SCIM service provider's entire set of resources.  It MUST be a stable, non-reassignable identifier that does not change when the same resource is returned in subsequent requests.

Each resource MAY include a non-empty \"externalId\" value.  The value of the \"externalId\" attribute is always issued by the provisioning client and MUST NOT be specified by the service provider.  The service provider MUST always interpret the externalId as scoped to the provisioning domain.  While the server does not enforce uniqueness, it is assumed that the value's uniqueness is controlled by the client setting the value.  See Section 9 for additional considerations regarding privacy.
